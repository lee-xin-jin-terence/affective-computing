# Identifying the Existence of Negative Emotion Patterns in Construction Workers from the United States during Work, in the High Suicide Rate Industry

## Introduction

### Construction Sector: Worryingly High Suicide Rate in Many Countries

In the United States, construction workers have the highest suicide rate among men, forming 16% of all suicide-related deaths in the country, with 1,404 deaths a year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). This is a worrying figure, considering that the occupation is a reason for the loss of four lives every single day.

Another analysis by Andersen et al. (2010) also concluded that there is an elevated risk of suicide among males in the construction sector in Queensland, Australia. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, Meltzer et al. (2008) discovered that construction workers have among the highest number of suicides among men. In Canada, Mustard et al. (2010) revealed similar results.

### Impact of Suicides on Family/Friends/Co-workers: Grief, Shame and Suicide

A meta-analysis by Sveen and Walby (2008) found that suicide survivors have elevated levels of “shame, stigma… and blaming than all other surviving groups." A study on a support group of survivors (Callahan, 2000) revealed that witnessing suicides is linked to significant levels of post-traumatic distress.

Cerel, Jordan and Duberstein (2008) stated that suicides could result in "complicated grief reactions, mental disorders, and even future suicides" among surviving family members. Similarly, Mitchell et al. (2005) found that grieving survivors of suicide victims are highly vulnerable to suicidal thoughts.

### Purpose of Research: Discover if Negative Emotion Pattern Exists in Construction Workers Throughout the Workday

Through this research, the author aims to find out if negative emotion patterns exist in construction workers from the United States during work. Studying their emotion patterns may reveal that the current work culture in the construction sector is indeed appalling and that more needs to be done to bring about changes. Helpful changes may include the provision of counselling services or allowing more work-life balance, as suggested by Kotera, Green & Sheffield (2019).

### Use of Affective Computing: Recording and Processing Large Amounts of Human Emotion Data

The idea of measuring human emotions is not new. Researchers have used cortisol concentration from human saliva (Schwartz et al., 1997; Pruessner, Hellhammer & Kirschbaum, 1999) and blood pressure (Räikkönen et al., 1999; Harris, 2001) as stress markers. However, these methods lack the ability for continuous and remote data collection. Affective Computing fills this gap.

Picard (1995) described Affective Computing as the ability of computers to sense and recognise human emotions. Tools such as wrist sensors (Sano and Picard, 2013) and facial recognition software (Gavrilescu and Vizireanu, 2019) now make it possible to generate large emotion datasets for analysis.

### Aim of Literature Review: Showing Unhealthiness of Construction Work Culture and Feasibility of Study

The first five papers reveal causes of the high suicide rate in the construction sector, indicating that sufficient research shows an unhealthy work culture. However, no research has individually analysed the moment-to-moment emotional effects on construction workers.

The final five papers demonstrate that Affective Computing technology is sufficiently developed to measure construction workers’ emotions accurately and practically. This shows that emotion tracking on construction sites is feasible.

## Causes of Poor Mental Health Among Construction Workers

### Relationship Issues, Substance Abuse Problems

Milner et al. (2017) conducted a qualitative study on male Australian construction worker suicides. Interviews with colleagues and family revealed leading causes like relationship problems, trouble adjusting to new environments, and substance abuse.

### Lack of Job Security, Long Work Hours

Heller, Hawgood & Leo (2007) used focus groups to determine suicide causes. Stressors included lack of job security, long hours, and poor management. One participant said, “…we are working 60 hours, some blokes are working 70/80 hours a week… it is just ridiculous.”

### High Job Demands

Boschman et al. (2013) assessed Dutch bricklayers' mental health. They found high depression rates (18%) and a strong need for recovery (14%). A lack of job control was also cited, though self-reporting may introduce bias.

### Absence of Decision Authority

Zaniboni et al. (2016) surveyed US construction workers and found that older workers with greater autonomy had higher job satisfaction. This implies that autonomy improves mental health and job satisfaction.

### Lack of Work-life Balance and Flexible Shifts

Kotera et al. (2019) found that poor work-life balance correlated with mental health problems. Inflexible shifts also contributed to emotional distress.

### Summary

Much research has examined the causes of suicides among construction workers, but little has explored their moment-to-moment emotions. This data is crucial for understanding suicide causes in depth.

## Affective Computing Development

### Emotion Sensing Through Hand Motion

Yamauchi and Xiao (2018) inferred emotions from mouse cursor movements. Participants were exposed to emotions via music, photos, and videos. While positive emotions were identified accurately, negative ones were not as easily detected.

### Emotion Sensing From Facial Expression

Using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), Gavrilescu and Vizireanu (2019) could detect depression, anxiety, and stress with high success rates (87.2%, 77.9%, and 90.2%, respectively).

### Emotion Sensing From Typing Speed and Pressure

Ghosh et al. (2019) developed *Touchsense*, an Android app that detected emotions through typing behaviour. It achieved 73% average accuracy in identifying four emotions (happy, relaxed, sad, stressed).

### Emotion Sensing from Wrist Sensors

Sano and Picard (2013) used wrist sensors to track stress in mobile phone users. Stress was detected with 75% accuracy using data like movement, conductance, and call frequency.

### Emotion Sensing From Head Movement and Body Posture

Kapoor, Burleson, and Picard (2007) used a multimodal tool to monitor frustration levels in students solving puzzles. They achieved a 79% accuracy rate using markers like posture, head movement, and skin conductance.

### Summary

The five studies show that current Affective Computing technology is capable of meeting the research needs. Continuous measurement of construction workers' emotions is feasible and accurate.

## Conclusion

### Purpose of Research & Hypothesis

This research seeks to determine whether negative emotional patterns are common in construction workers during work. Using Affective Computing for continuous emotion recording offers a new understanding of why suicides occur.

This study is crucial for providing evidence to drive cultural change in the construction industry. Affective Computing makes it feasible to continuously measure emotions, enabling rich data collection.

Based on the literature, the author hypothesises that negative emotion patterns do exist during construction work, likely due to the sector's unhealthy culture and high suicide rates.

### Ultimate Aim of Research: Provide Sufficient Evidence to Push for Culture Change in Construction Sector

Human lives are sacred. It is tragic that people take their own lives due to their occupation. This also deeply affects those around them. Therefore, it is vital to stop these unnecessary deaths.
